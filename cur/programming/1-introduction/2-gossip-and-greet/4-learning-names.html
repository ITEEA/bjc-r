        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a <code>greet player</code> script that greets users (such as &quot;Anthony&quot;) by either:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Saying &quot;Nice to <em>meet</em> you, Anthony&quot; and storing Anthony&apos;s name in a <var>player list</var> for next time.</li> 
                    or
                    <li>Saying &quot;Nice to <em>see</em> you again, Anthony&quot; if  Anthony&apos;s name is already on the list.</li>
                </ol>
        <!--        <div class="sidenote">This project is an introductory example of a cutting edge field in computer science called Machine Learning.</div>  -->

		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"> 
            <ol>
                <div class="vocabBig"><a name="AP" class="anchor">&#xA0;</a>
                    <p>
                        The decision is made by <code>if-else</code>. <br>
                        <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player-skeleton.png" alt="greet player skeleton" title="greet player skeleton"><br>
                        The <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks are called <em>conditionals</em> because they control the code based on a <strong>condition</strong> (here, whether the list of players contains this player&apos;s name). Deciding (selecting) which part of an algorithm to run based on a condition is called <strong>selection</strong>.
                    </p>
                	<p><strong>Sequencing</strong> is the process of <em>ordering</em> the code (putting it in a sequence), as you do here.</p>
                </div> 
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L2-GreetPlayer.xml" class="run" title="open projectU1L2-GreetPlayer.xml&#xFFFD;">Load this file</a>, and save it to your Snap<em>!</em> account. It contains most of the code you&apos;ll need to make the script.</li>
				<li>
                    Snap the pieces together in a sequence so that:
					  <ol type="a">
                        <li>The greeter will <code>ask</code> the player for their name.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>If</strong> the player&apos;s name is in the  <var>player list</var>, 
                            <ul><li><code>Say</code> &quot;nice to see you again, <em>player name</em>.&quot; </li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Otherwise</strong> when the player isn&apos;t on the list,
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>Say</code> &quot;nice to meet you, <em>player name</em>,&quot; and </li>
                                <li><code>Add</code> the player&apos;s name to the <var>player list</var>. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
				</li>
				<li>Test and debug. Make sure the script works the way you want it to.</li>
				<li>Create a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player.png" alt="player greeter block" title="player greeter block"> <em>command</em> block, and drag in your working script.</li>
                <li>Click <code>greet player</code> several times to test that it works as expected. Fix any bugs.</li>

                    Add some enhancements to your script. For example:
                    <ol>
                        <li>If the guest is new, have the greeter ask &quot;Do you have any pets?&quot; and if they say &quot;yes,&quot; then ask them what type of pet they have and store the answer along with the guest&apos;s name. <div class="sidenoteBig">Each entry to <var>player list</var> can be a list of <var>name</var> and <var>kind of pet</var> for each guest. </div></li>
                        <li>If the guest is known to the greeter and has a pet, have the greeter say &quot;How&apos;s your <em>dog, cat, bird, ...</em>?&quot; getting the kind of pet from the <var>player list</var>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
