    	<h2>Fair Use</h2>
 		<div class="learn">
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about times when it is ok to copy part of someone else&apos;s work.</p>
        </div>

    	<p>
        	Copyright protection is not absolute. Various kinds of &quot;fair use&quot; are allowed by US and some other countries&apos; copyright laws. Here are some examples of fair use:
            <ul>
				<li>
					<strong>You can quote a <em>short</em> excerpt from someone else&apos;s work for purposes of reviewing the original.</strong> 
					<div class="endnote">The definition of &quot;short&quot; is complicated and is different for different works. You might be able to use an entire page of a long novel, but in the picture books written for very young children, a page would be a significant fraction of the entire work, and would not be allowed. It took several lawsuits to settle whether the hip-hop technique of<em> sampling</em> older music was legal.  (The answer: generally not, unless permission is given by both the recording artists and the song writers.)</div>
				</li>
                <li>
                	<strong>You can copy newspaper articles for use in teaching a class <em>if</em></strong> the event reported in the article was not anticipated when you planned your class <em>and</em> you don&apos;t keep using the same article year after year.
					<div class="endnote">This is why our &quot;Computing in the News&quot; is legal, even if your teacher passes out copies of actual news articles. (This kind of fair use may also apply to material that isn&apos;t brand new like a news article, but it&apos;s harder to make the argument that you couldn&apos;t have anticipated the need for it when planning your course.)</div>
				</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>You can produce a <em>parody</em> of a copyrighted work.</strong>
					<div class="endnote">The most famous case of this kind is the 2001 novel <em>The Wind Done Gone,</em> by Alice Randall.  It retells the story of Margaret Mitchell&apos;s 1936 novel <em>Gone with the Wind,</em> which concerns a wealthy slave owner from the pre-Civil-War South named Scarlett O&apos;Hara.  The Randall novel tells the story from the point of view of one of Scarlett&apos;s slaves, Cynara.  Mitchell&apos;s estate sued Randall and her publisher for copyright violation, but Randall claimed fair use under the parody rule.  After an appeals court overturned a ruling against Randall, the case was eventually settled after the publisher, Houghton Mifflin, donated part of the profits to the historically-Black Morehouse College.</div>

        	There are other ways you can use someone else&apos;s words that aren&apos;t technically &quot;fair use&quot; but are legal:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Titles are not copyrightable at all.</strong> You can write a song and call it &quot;She Loves You,&quot; as long as the song itself is different from the Beatles&apos; version.</li>
                <li>You can, of course, copy anything <strong>if you get permission</strong> from the copyright holder.</li>
                <li><strong>Authors who want their works to be generally available</strong> and to be usable in ways they may not have thought of themselves, such as the authors of this curriculum, will often include with their works a general license allowing anyone to use them, such as a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> license.</li>
                <div class="endnote">Look at the bottom of this page. This curriculum is under a CC-BY-NC-SA license, which means that anyone can use and publish the curriculum or a modification of it, provided that they credit the authors (<em>BY</em> The University of California, Berkeley, and Education Development Center, Inc.), they use it non-commercially (<em>NC</em>, not for profit), and they license any modified version under the same terms (<em>SA</em>, share-alike). Because of the NC part, this is not technically a &quot;free license,&quot; which would allow use for <em>any</em> purpose (including for-profit). People argue over whether it&apos;s ethically necessary to allow that much freedom of use.</div>
